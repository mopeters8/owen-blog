        <p>
          Iâ€™m an aspiring software engineer & web developer who loves to solve
          problems, collaborate, and learn.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>I just graduated from the University of San Francisco and
          obtained my Bachelors in Science degree for computer science.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Through my experiences of past jobs and a passion for computers and
          video games, I am pursuing a career in the software development
          industry. Growing up with electronics, PCs, and gaming consoles my
          whole life, I have developed a passion for everything computer
          related. My hobbies include tinkering and building, diving deep into
          the details of the electronic gaming industry, watching sports, and
          eating good food.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>I plan to continue to learn as much as I can about software
          engineering, web development, and the gaming industry. I would love a
          career that would welcome my eagerness, passion and tenacity to learn.
