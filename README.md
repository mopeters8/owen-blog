# General Information from Maker

This is just a side project. I would love to create a blog to share my projects, passions and things that are keeping me busy. I hope many others such as friends, family or people just interested will feel inclined to post and use the site as well. I want to add a lot, so I would love to complete this side project. Thank you for reading!
